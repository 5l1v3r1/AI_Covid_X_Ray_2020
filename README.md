# AI_Covid_X_Ray_2020

    I decide to wrote a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to contribute in the global strugle against the Covid-19.
    At best it would help doctors to pre-diagnose Covid patient and allow doctors to focus on pre-selected people to save time.
    At least it would be a good training to use CNN from an educational perspective.
    PS: This is a Deep Learning project not a medicinal project.
